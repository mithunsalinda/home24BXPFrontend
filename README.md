üß† Conclusion
This project demonstrates a well-structured product management dashboard using modern React practices. It meets all the required use cases and can be extended with features like real authentication, backend integration, role-based access, and analytics tracking.

‚ú® Suggestions for improvement:

Replace mock login with JWT-based real backend auth

Add role-based permissions (Admin, Editor)

Support for CSV/Excel import/export

Add drag-and-drop support in category tree

Use WebSockets or polling to update ‚Äúlast modified‚Äù product in real-time
